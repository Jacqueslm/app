### Security audit — shared links (28 Aug)

Two things fixed in the paths a stranger can reach:

- **Together codes are now generated with a proper random source.** They used
  to come from `Math.random()`, whose generator can be worked out from a few
  codes you have already seen — meaning someone who made a handful of their own
  links could in principle guess other people's. Now `crypto.randomInt`.
- **Joining with a code is rate limited** — 20 attempts an hour per network.
  A six-character code is short enough to guess at if nothing stops you trying
  a million times; now something stops you.

Checked and found fine: letter links use a 128-bit random token (unguessable),
letter creation and letter-accept were already rate limited, and a letter that
is unknown, revoked, or expired all look identical to whoever opens it.
